            <h4>My name is Peter</h4>
            <p> Thank you for taking the time to check out my first website! I think this is going to be a work in progress forever. I plan to upload and keep updated all my relevant works in my <a id="portfolio-link" href="#">Portfolio</a>, make a collection of useful websites in the <a id="links-link" href="#">Links</a> section, and make some of my webapps easily accessible for myself, or for anybody else of course. You may also find some information about me, download my <a href="#" id="cv-link">CV</a>, or contact me on the ways you can see below.</p><br>

            <h4>I learn to code</h4>
            <p> The main reason I created this site is not long ago I started to learn coding. Although I spent my last 12 years in the tourism industry, I decided to make a change to my whole life. At 33 years of age, I decided to become a programmer. At the beginning I have been studying at home with online courses of <a href="http://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, but now I'm attending a "live" Junior Software Developer course. My aim is to get my first developer job by the end of the year! <em>Wish me luck!</em>  </p><br>

            <h4>I love to travel</h4>
            <p> The thing I enjoy the most on this world is traveling. I agree to the saying <em>"Traveling is the only thing you can buy and makes you richer."</em> Working in any part of the tourism industry has it's perks: sometimes free, but mostly discounted trips to more and more interesting places. Whenever I have the chance, I hop on a plance and go to discover new destinations, preferably first in East Asia or just around Europe. You can check out what I've seen yet on the <a id="travels-link" href="#">Travel</a> page.</p><br>

            <h4>I'm also interested in</h4>
            <p> My second biggest passion is a bit in connection with my love to travel. During my trips I really fell in love with the Far East, especially with Korea and Japan. Their culture, history, ways of living, and just their people simply amaze me. Not to mention their cuisine... I often take time to read and learn more about them, I also learn Korean as my third language, and of course continously planning my next journey to my favorite countries. </p><br>
